random_act_of_doge_bot
======================
This bot is designed to choose one /r/dogecoin user per hour, and tip them a random amount of dogecoin between two set integers.
Credit- Thanks to /u/spacer0cketfor cleaning up the code and adding some cool new features!
Credit 2- Thanks to Panchr(I don't know your reddit username) who wrote the code that sends a reply that says how long the bot is funded for! That was a big help!
